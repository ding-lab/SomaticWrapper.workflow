Create SomaticWrapper.workflow project, based on similar work for GDC_Import
    This is essentially SomaticWrapper.analysis, but not project specific

Create SomaticWrapper.CPTAC3.b1.MGI, which is a thin project which drives .workflow

All submission scripts, tracking of processing, MGI vs. DC2 functionality, etc. is moved to .workflow

Need to import all GDC_import projects to epazote
